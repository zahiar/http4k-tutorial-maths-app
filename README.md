# HTTP4K Tutorial - Maths App

This repository is just me following the TDDing http4k tutorial, which can be found here: https://www.http4k.org/tutorials/tdding_http4k/

Sadly the tutorial didn't provide a nice list of dependencies required to get a base app up and running smoothly, so an element of 
reverse-engineering the code provided was required to figure out what was needed, so that I could get my base Gradle app up & running.

Hopefully this repository helps others who may want to tackle this tutorial :)
